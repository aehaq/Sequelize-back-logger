# Sequelize-Back-Logger
Back-Logger is a full-stack web application which uses Object Relational Mapping to manage sql functions and Express.js to display a front-end application to users. This website stores and allows users to manage a virtual back-log of media they plan to consume, or have already consumed. A SQL database hosted on the server stores all items to display on the list, and dynamically responds to a user's requests to create or update information within the database.

This Version of BackLogger uses Sequelize instead of a native ORM set up. 

The original Back-Logger app is located on GitHub here: https://github.com/aehaq/Back-Logger
